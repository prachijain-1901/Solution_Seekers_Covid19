Topic 
Analyze and visualize COVID-19 case trends and vaccination data by country.


Objective 
The objective of studying the topic COVID-19 Global Case Trends is to analyze the evolution, spread, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across different regions of the world, following are the reasons,


1)	Tracking Case Numbers: Monitoring the number of confirmed infections, recoveries, and deaths globally to understand the scale and intensity of the pandemic over time.

2)	Identifying Patterns: Identifying patterns in the spread of the virus, such as peak infection periods, regions most affected, and the impact of government interventions like lockdowns, vaccination campaigns, and social distancing measures.

3)	Comparing Geographies: Comparing the case trends between different countries or regions to assess the effectiveness of public health responses, healthcare infrastructure, and vaccination rates.

4)	Understanding Variants: Tracking the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus and their potential influence on case trends, transmission rates, and vaccine efficacy.

5)	Predicting Future Trends: Using data to model potential future trends in COVID-19 cases, which can inform policy decisions, resource allocation, and preparedness for subsequent waves.

Steps to execute our project 
Step 1: Open GitHub link
https://github.com/prachijain-1901/Solution_Seekers_Covid19 
Step 2: Run all the code according to which you want the data for ex, country, state, recovered, deaths etc.
Step 3: All codes will get executed and will show interactive graphs as output.


Summary 
1.	Data Visualization: The dashboard uses interactive graphs to present COVID-19 data and vaccination statistics, helping users track the progression of the pandemic and vaccination rates for different countries over time.
2.	Country-Specific Data: Users can select a country from a dropdown list, and the graphs will update dynamically to show trends for the selected country. This feature is helpful for comparing how different countries are managing COVID-19 cases and vaccinations.
3.	Interactive Analysis: The interactive nature of the dashboard, powered by tool like ploty, allows users to explore the data in a user-friendly way. They can zoom in on specific time periods, compare trends, and view the impact of COVID-19 and vaccinations visually.

Challenges Faced
1)	Data Availability and Quality: The accuracy, granularity, and timeliness of COVID-19 data can vary significantly between countries, sources, and times.
2)	Data Formatting and Cleaning: COVID-19 data often comes in different formats (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.), requiring preprocessing before it can be analyzed.
3)	Handling Large Datasets: COVID-19 datasets can be large, especially when dealing with historical data across many countries and regions.
4)	Visualizing the Data: Effectively visualizing COVID-19 trends across multiple countries or regions can be overwhelming, especially when trying to convey meaningful insights.
